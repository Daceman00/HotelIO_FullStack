📖 Project Overview

HotelIO is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application developed to digitalize and optimize hotel business operations.
The system provides efficient management of rooms, reservations, users, reviews, and business analytics — all through an intuitive and responsive interface.
